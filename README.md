home-page
=========

Jump-off or home page I designed for personal use.

The site is more of a practice for playing with things like CSS3 button styles, a Google search bar, flexbox etc.

I was really excited about Angus Frewell's [Flex-Layout] (https://github.com/angusfretwell/flex-layout) solution with BYOW (bring your own widths.) It's a very simple approach to working with flexible layouts.

It is also responsive.
